    "Index Error: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range. This typically happens when you try to access an element at an index that doesn't exist in a list, tuple, or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Error: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Not Found Error: Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "IOError: Raised when an input/output operation fails, such as when a file cannot be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "ZeroDivision Error: Raised when division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.\n",

    "Q5\n",
    "In Python, logging refers to the process of recording messages, events, or information about the execution of a program to a file, the console, or other output streams. The logging module in Python provides a flexible framework for generating log messages with different levels of severity and capturing them in various destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is crucial in software development for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging and troubleshooting: When developing software, it's common to encounter errors or unexpected behaviors. By incorporating logging statements strategically throughout the code, developers can capture relevant information about the program's execution. These log messages can help in identifying issues, understanding the flow of execution, and tracing the source of errors, making the debugging and troubleshooting process more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring and auditing: Logging allows developers and system administrators to monitor the health and performance of an application in real-time or by reviewing historical logs. By logging important events, such as system errors, warnings, or critical actions, developers can gain insights into how the software behaves under different conditions. This information is valuable for identifying performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, or patterns of misuse, aiding in system optimization and auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-mortem analysis: In the event of a failure or crash, logs can serve as a valuable resource for post-mortem analysis. By examining the log messages leading up to the failure, developers can reconstruct the sequence of events and understand what caused the problem. This information helps in diagnosing and fixing the issue promptly, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication and collaboration: In larger software development teams, logging provides a means of communication and collaboration among team members. Developers can use logs to communicate important information or share insights about specific code sections. Logs act as a record of execution, enabling multiple team members to gain visibility into the behavior of the software without relying on direct communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance profiling: By strategically placing logging statements around critical sections of code, developers can measure the execution time of specific operations or functions. This technique is known as performance profiling and helps in identifying performance bottlenecks or areas of improvement. By analyzing the logged execution times, developers can optimize the code and improve the overall performance of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, logging in Python is important for debugging, monitoring, auditing, post-mortem analysis, team collaboration, and performance profiling. It provides valuable insights into the execution of a program, aiding in the development, maintenance, and optimization of software systems.\n",
    " Q 6.\n",
    "In Python logging, log levels are used to categorize log messages based on their importance or severity. They help developers control the verbosity of log output and make it easier to filter and analyze log data. Python provides several predefined log levels, each serving a specific purpose. The commonly used log levels, in increasing order of severity, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG: This level is used for detailed debugging information. It is typically used during development and should be disabled in production environments. Examples of when to use DEBUG level include tracking the flow of execution, variable values, or any other detailed information helpful for troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO: This level is used to provide general information about the program's execution. It is typically used to communicate the progress or major events happening within the application. Examples of when to use INFO level include startup messages, successful completion of significant operations, or any other noteworthy events that can help understand the application's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: This level indicates that something unexpected happened or could potentially cause issues. It is used to highlight non-critical issues that may require attention. Examples of when to use WARNING level include deprecation warnings, resource allocation warnings, or any other potentially problematic situations that don't immediately affect the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR: This level is used to indicate errors that prevent the program from functioning properly. It represents more severe issues that need attention and possibly corrective action. Examples of when to use ERROR level include exceptions or errors that cause the program to terminate prematurely, file or network access failures, or any other critical issues affecting the application's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL: This level represents the most severe log messages. It indicates a critical failure or error that requires immediate attention. Examples of when to use CRITICAL level include unrecoverable errors, system-level failures, or any other conditions that result in the application's complete inability to continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting the appropriate log level, you can control which log messages are displayed or saved based on their severity. This allows you to filter the log output and focus on the relevant information during different stages of development or in various deployment environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log formatters in Python logging are responsible for defining the structure and content of log messages. They allow you to specify how log records are formatted before being emitted. The log formatter determines the information included in the log message, such as the timestamp, log level, module name, function name, and the actual log message itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's logging module provides a default log formatter, but you can customize it or create your own formatter to suit your specific needs. Customizing the log formatter involves creating an instance of the logging.Formatter class and configuring its format string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format string is a template that specifies placeholders for various log record attributes. Some commonly used placeholders include:\n",
    "\n",
    "%(asctime)s: The timestamp of the log record.\n",
    "%(level name)s: The log level name.\n",
    "%(name)s: The logger name.\n",
    "%(message)s: The log message.\n",
    "You can combine these placeholders with text and other formatting options to create a desired log message format. For example, a basic log formatter format string could be \"%(asctime)s - %(level name)s - %(message)s\", which would display the timestamp, log level, and log message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To customize the log formatter in Python logging, you can create an instance of logging.Formatter, set your desired format string using the format parameter, and then attach the formatter to your logger or handler using the Set For Matter() method.\n",

    "\n",
    "Import the logging module in your Python code \n",
    "import logging\n",
    "Configure the logging system with the desired settings. You can do this at the beginning of your application or in a central configuration file. Here's an example configuration that sets up a basic logger to capture messages at the INFO level and above, and logs them to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.INFO)\n",
    "In each module or section of your code where you want to generate log messages, create a logger object specific to that module. This allows you to organize your logs based on their source. Use the module's name as the logger name to keep it consistent\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(_name_)\n",
    "Start logging messages from your module using the logger object. You can include log messages with different severity levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "logger.info('This is an informational message')\n",
    "logger.warning('This is a warning message')\n",
    "logger.error('This is an error message')\n",
    "Repeat steps 3-4 for each module or section of your code that you want to log messages from.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your application runs, log messages will be captured according to the logging configuration you set up. In this example, they will be written to the file specified in the Basic Config call.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or a Python application. This approach allows you to have centralized control over your logging settings and collect log messages from different parts of your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    " Q9\n",
    "In Python, logging and print statements are both used for displaying information during program execution, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between logging and print statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output destination: The primary difference between logging and print statements lies in their output destinations. Print statements send the output directly to the standard output stream (usually the console), while logging provides more flexibility in where the output is directed. The output from logging can be sent to various destinations such as the console, log files, email, databases, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging levels and severity: Logging supports different severity levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. Each log message can be assigned a severity level to indicate its importance or severity. On the other hand, print statements do not provide built-in support for distinguishing the importance or severity of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control and filtering: Logging allows you to control the verbosity of log messages and filter them based on severity levels. You can configure the logging system to display only messages above a certain severity level, which can be helpful for debugging or troubleshooting purposes. In contrast, print statements are always displayed unless they are conditionally omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity and context: Logging provides a more granular approach to outputting information. It allows you to log messages at different points in your code, providing a context that can help identify the source of an issue. With print statements, you generally have less control over where the output occurs, making it harder to pinpoint specific areas of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term maintenance and debugging: In real-world applications, it is often desirable to have a consistent and manageable way of capturing program output. Logging is better suited for long-term maintenance and debugging because log messages can be selectively enabled or disabled without modifying the code itself. This flexibility is beneficial when you need to troubleshoot issues in a production environment, as you can turn on more detailed logging without modifying the application's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, you should consider using logging over print statements in real-world applications when you need more control over where the output is directed, the ability to distinguish between different severity levels, the capability to selectively enable or disable logging messages, and better long-term maintainability and debugging options. Print statements, on the other hand, are more suitable for quick debugging or temporary output to the console during development\n",

    "Make sure to save the program in a Python file (e.g., error_logger.py) and execute it using a Python interpreter. Any exceptions occurring within the try block will be logged to both the console and the \"errors.log\" file.\n",
